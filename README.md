## Walkthru Python Crash Course 2e

Suddenly become data engineers. Work thru Chapters 15, 16 & 17 in __Python Crash Course, 2nd edition__.

- Ch 15 Generating Data
- Ch 16 Downloading Data
- Ch 17 Working with APIs

_It's possible that these chapters have links to web APIs or things that might not exist anymore._
Look for alternatives like for the HackerNews API, use [https://github.com/HackerNews/API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)
for information on how to get the Top Stories, and the detail on them. This is more up to date than what
is described on (page 372).

_Installing MATPLOTLIB might also be something you have to google to get updated instructions on._ (Page 306)

_I have also provided the `data` directory with the needed data files for the chapters._

### The Provided Code

The code in the three `.py` files is there to make your instructor comfortable that you can do this lab.
Each one is __NOT__ what the books talks about, but rather a simpler _test of the installed libraries._

Which installed libraries? Well, these below...

### Things to install

```
python3 -m pip install --user matplotlib
python3 -m pip install --user plotly
python3 -m pip install --user requests
```

#### NotaBene

You're going to find it hard to copy paste from the pdf. The formatting get all fuzzled.
I'd suggest you _just type it all in_ as you go. 

Let your fingers do the learning.(TM)
